# Description

This repository contains the implementation of a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project. The project consists of an algorithms that generate and analyze various FIR filters using the Kaiser Window method.

The Kaiser window method is a technique used to design Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. FIR filters are digital filters that are commonly used in signal processing applications to remove unwanted frequencies from a signal.
The parameters for each filter can be changed as required in the "main.m" file. The details about the function arguments are provided in the function file itself. This project involves creating Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass and Bandstop filters and viewing their frequency response in the output window. 
## Deployment

To deploy this project copy and run the command in GIT bash.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bluejoggers/DSP-Project.git
```
Once cloned, go to the folder, paste the main.m file in a folder along with all the function files, launch MATLAB and run the main.m file. 

## Prerequisites

This project requires the following software to be installed on your system:

* MATLAB (version R2020a or later)
* Signal Processing Toolbox for MATLAB

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

* function: contains the function files used for the generating different filters.
* result: contains the result of a test run in the form of MATLAB figure.
* main.m: The main MATLAB file that assosciates to all the function files and generates the output. You can change the parameters of the filters by changing the arguments to the function calls.
